                    <strong>ABOUT</strong> <br>
                    Thailand is in the heart of Southeast Asia.<br>
                    Cambodia and Laos border the country to the east <br>
                    and northeast, and Myanmar lies to the northwest. <br>
                    To the west is the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of <br>
                    Thailand, southeast of Burma. The long southern 
                    <br>region, connecting with Malaysia, is hilly<br> 
                    and forested. The highest mountains are in 
                    <br>northern Thailand.

                    <strong id="clothing"> CLOTHING</strong><br>
                    From the 6th to 13th century under the Dvaravati Kingdom, Thai clothing was greatly influenced 
                    <br>by India. Loincloths, gold necklaces, and metal belts were amongst the styles that influenced 
                    <br>fashion within Thailand. During the 7th century, fashion in Thailand was influenced by the Khmer, 
                    <br>with clothing styles such as shorter dresses.<br><br>

                    The Ayutthaya Era has influenced the fashion of Central Thailand for nearly 200 years. The most 
                    <br>popular style amongst women is the ankle-length tube skirt. However, older generations of women 
                    <br>wear the traditional ‘jong krabane,’ a style of skirt made of hand-woven cotton gathered, 
                    <br>rolled, and threaded between the legs.<br><br>

                    Tribal groups Thai-Lue, Thai Kern, and Thai Yai greatly continue to influence the fashion of 
                    <br>Northern Thailand. Styles include indigo-dyed blouses fastened on the side and ankle-length 
                    <br>tube skirts. The tube-skirts are designed more elegantly for formal occasions with colorful 
                    <br>weaving down the middle and decorated hems.<br><br>

                    Across the Southern region of Thailand, men and women don brilliantly colored batik-patterned 
                    <br>sarongs. Women pair their sarongs with loosely fitted lace blouses, worn outside of the sarong 
                    <br>and an open front. The Malaysian ‘yaya’ style influences this popular look. Women will also 
                    <br>wear a shawl that covers both the head and shoulders in compliance with Muslim beliefs.<br>

                    When in Thailand, you’ll notice that they eat their rice dishes differently from other Asian countries.
                    <br>Instead of chopsticks, you’ll be given a fork and spoon at your table setting. The spoon is your 
                    <br>primary eating utensil while the fork is used to manipulate the food onto your spoon. We have 
                    <br>adopted this tradition at home when we eat our own Thai dishes and it is far more efficient.

                    As the most important date in the Thai calendar, the Thai New Year or Songkran is 
                    <br>celebrated nationwide through various exciting events. Get ready to be wet during 
                    <br>this season, as splashing water is the norm throughout (better to bring your own 
                    <br>water gun too)!<br><br>
                    There’s the Had Yai Midnight Songkran in Songkhla and I San Maha Songkran 
                    <br>Festival in Nong Khai, where you can come and splash water and watch a beauty 
                    <br>pageant. You can also immerse yourself in traditional Thai culture and join the 
                    <br>beautiful Songkran procession during the Ayutthaya Songkran Festival (Old 
                    <br>Capital’s Songkran). The Phra Pradaeng Songkran in Phra Pradaeng, Samut 
                    <br>Prakarn, is formerly known as the “Pak Lat Songkran Festival”, with the notable 
                    <br>addition of a colorful and elaborate Songkran procession staged by the Mon, or 
                    <br>Raman, residents of Phra Pradaeng. Chiangmai also celebrates its own Songkran 
                    <br>Festival with the same spectacular Songkran procession, culture shows and beauty contest.

                    With over 1500 miles (2500km) of coastline and 1430 islands, Thailand’s 
                    <br>beaches deliver everything. Expect everything from otherworldly craggy 
                    <br>limestone formations that appear to be precariously balanced on the turquoise sea, 
                    <br>to colorful coral reefs whose inhabitants are best observed with snorkels and fins. 
                    <br>Along many of those sands, beach shacks and street vendors sell fragrant regional 
                    <br>grilled skewers and noodle dishes.<br>
                    These beguiling beaches continue to attract all sorts of beach lovers, from 
                    <br>backpack-toting cash-strapped students and families on holiday to those craving a 
                    <br>buzzy scene or salt air pampering. November to March is probably the best time 
                    <br>to visit Thailand to enjoy the most these spots have to offer.<br><br>
